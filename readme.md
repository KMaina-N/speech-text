# Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech Conversion

This Python script uses the `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` libraries to convert speech to text and text to speech.

## Dependencies

- `speech_recognition`
- `pyttsx3`

You can install these dependencies using pip:


```pip install speech_recognition pyttsx3```

or alternatively using requirements.txt

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

How it works
The script initializes a speech recognition engine and continuously listens for user input through the microphone. It then uses Google's speech recognition to convert the audio input to text.

The speak function is used to convert text to speech. It initializes a text-to-speech engine, feeds it the text, and runs the engine to produce the speech output.

Usage
Run the script in a Python environment. It will start listening for your voice input and convert it to text. To stop the script, interrupt the process (Ctrl+C in most terminals).
